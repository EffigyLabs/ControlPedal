# ControlPedal
This is the OS for the Effigy Control Pedal.  It is written as a processing script, compiled in gnuc++ in the arduino IDE.

.ino files should be in their own directory, reflecting the same name as the sketch.  So, for example, the sketch R4C_15.ino needs to be in the sketch folder, in a folder named R4C_15, like this:  .../sketch/R4C_15/R4C_15.ino.  Same as with the other .ino scripts.
